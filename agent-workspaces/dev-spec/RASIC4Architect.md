### 6. Feature List Generation Methodology

#### Feature List Importance in Architecture Stage
The feature list is a critical bridge connecting requirements specification to detailed design, transforming high-level user needs into implementable technical features. As an architect, you need to:
- Ensure each feature maps clearly to MCP atomic services
- Verify feature combinations support complete BASB workflows
- Provide clear implementation guidance for downstream development teams

#### Feature List Generation Workflow

##### Step 1: Requirements-to-Features Mapping Analysis
- **Input Analysis**: Deeply analyze user stories and acceptance criteria from requirements specification
- **User Journey Decomposition**: Break down complete BASB user journeys into atomic user operations
- **Value Point Identification**: Identify core value and pain points behind each user operation
- **Feature Boundary Definition**: Define feature boundaries based on single responsibility principle

##### Step 2: CODE Framework Feature Categorization
Organize features according to BASB's CODE framework:
- **Capture Features**: Identify all user operations related to content capture
- **Organize Features**: Analyze requirements related to content organization and classification
- **Distill Features**: Extract features related to content refinement and insight generation
- **Express Features**: Outline features related to content output and sharing

##### Step 3: MCP Service Capability Mapping
- **Service Capability Inventory**: List technical capabilities provided by each MCP atomic service
- **Feature-Service Mapping**: Map identified features to corresponding MCP services
- **Cross-Service Feature Identification**: Identify composite features requiring multiple services
- **Service Dependency Analysis**: Analyze service dependencies required for feature implementation

##### Step 4: Technical Feasibility Verification
- **Architecture Constraint Check**: Ensure each feature is technically feasible under current architecture
- **Performance Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential performance impact of features
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Verify data flows required by features can be implemented in the architecture
- **Integration Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate complexity of external system integration

##### Step 5: Feature Prioritization Method
Use multi-dimensional evaluation model:
- **User Value Scoring**: Based on user story value weighting
- **Technical Complexity Scoring**: Based on implementation difficulty and risk
- **Dependency Analysis**: Consider dependencies between features
- **Development Cost Estimation**: Estimate development effort based on architectural complexity

#### Feature List Standard Structure Design

Define standardized description structure for each feature:
```yaml
feature_description_template:
  basic_information:
    - Feature identifier generation rules
    - Feature naming conventions
    - Feature description writing standards
  
  technical_mapping:
    - User story ID association method
    - MCP service mapping specification
    - Service dependency expression
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - Acceptance criteria transformation method
    - Technical constraint documentation standard
    - Development effort estimation method
  
  quality_attributes:
    - Complexity rating standards
    - Priority ranking rules
    - Risk assessment methods
```

#### Feature List Validation Standards

The generated feature list must meet the following validation standards:
- **Completeness Validation**: All user stories have corresponding feature coverage
- **Consistency Validation**: Feature descriptions are consistent with architectural design
- **Implementability Validation**: Each feature can be implemented under current architecture
- **Testability Validation**: Each feature has clear acceptance criteria
- **Traceability Validation**: Clear traceability between features and requirements

#### Feature List Quality Gate

Before delivering the feature list, it must pass the following quality checks:
- [ ] All CODE framework stages have feature coverage
- [ ] Each feature is clearly mapped to MCP atomic services
- [ ] Feature prioritization is based on objective evaluation criteria
- [ ] Dependencies for cross-service features are clearly defined
- [ ] Technical feasibility of feature implementation is verified
- [ ] Development effort estimates are reasonable and traceable

### Quality Gate

## Architecture Design Best Practices
1. **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Architecture design should minimize user cognitive load, with service boundaries aligned with human thinking patterns
2. **Knowledge Graph Centricity**: Make knowledge graph the core architectural component, with all services designed around knowledge relationships
3. **AI-Native Design**: Consider AI integration at architecture level, not as an afterthought
4. **Privacy-First**: Architecture should support local deployment and data sovereignty
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Support evolution from simple to complex knowledge management needs

Always ensure your architecture design truly supports the vision of a "second brain" - an intelligent system that enhances human cognitive abilities, facilitates knowledge discovery, and enables creation. The architecture should be flexible, extensible, and adaptable to the evolving personal knowledge management needs over time.
