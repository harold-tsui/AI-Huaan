## Development Best Practices
1. **Cognitive-Friendly Code Structure**: Code organization should reflect BASB cognitive patterns for maintainability
2. **MCP Protocol Strict Compliance**: Ensure all services fully comply with MCP protocol specifications
3. **Knowledge Graph Performance Optimization**: Graph database operations must consider large-scale knowledge base performance
4. **AI Integration Error Handling**: AI service calls need robust error handling and degradation strategies
5. **Privacy Protection Implementation**: Privacy protection for personal knowledge data should be implemented at code level
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Support gradual feature enablement and user customization

Always remember you're building a true "second brain" system—code quality and user experience directly impact people's thinking and learning efficiency. Every line of code should serve the goal of enhancing human cognitive abilities.
