# API Change Management Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for managing changes to the BASB system APIs. It defines the workflow for submitting, reviewing, implementing, and communicating API changes to ensure orderly evolution of the API ecosystem while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing disruption to API consumers.

## API Change Types

### Non-Breaking Changes

Changes that do not break existing client implementations:

- Adding new API endpoints
- Adding optional request parameters
- Adding new properties to response objects
- Adding new enum values
- Relaxing validation rules
- Adding new error codes
- Performance improvements with identical behavior

### Breaking Changes

Changes that may break existing client implementations:

- Removing or renaming API endpoints
- Removing or renaming request parameters
- Making optional parameters required
- Removing or renaming properties from response objects
- Changing property types or formats
- Changing error codes or error response format
- Changing authentication or authorization requirements
- Changing rate limits or quotas

## API Change Request Workflow

### 1. Change Request Submission

1. **Create Change Request**: The requester creates a formal API Change Request (ACR) document containing:
   - Description of the proposed change
   - Justification for the change
   - Type of change (breaking or non-breaking)
   - Affected endpoints and components
   - Proposed implementation approach
   - Backward compatibility considerations
   - Proposed timeline

2. **Initial Classification**: The Interface Engineer classifies the change as breaking or non-breaking based on the criteria above.

3. **Submit for Review**: The change request is submitted to the API Review Board through the designated tracking system.

### 2. Change Request Review

1. **Technical Review**: The Interface Engineer conducts a technical review to assess:
   - Technical feasibility
   - Alignment with API design standards
   - Impact on existing clients
   - Security implications
   - Performance implications

2. **Stakeholder Review**: Relevant stakeholders (product managers, architects, module owners) review the change request to assess:
   - Business value
   - Alignment with product roadmap
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline feasibility

3. **Review Outcome**: The API Review Board decides to:
   - Approve the change request
   - Reject the change request
   - Request modifications to the change request

### 3. Change Implementation

1. **Update API Specification**: The Interface Engineer updates the API specification (OpenAPI/Protocol Buffers) to reflect the approved changes.

2. **Create Implementation Plan**: Develop a detailed implementation plan including:
   - Code changes required
   - Test cases
   - Deployment strategy
   - Rollback plan

3. **Implementation**: Implement the changes according to the plan.

4. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing including:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Backward compatibility tests
   - Performance tests
   - Security tests

5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect the changes.

### 4. Change Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy changes to the staging environment for final validation.

2. **Pre-release Communication**: For breaking changes, communicate the upcoming changes to affected API consumers with sufficient notice (see Communication Plan below).

3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy changes to production according to the deployment strategy:
   - For non-breaking changes: Standard deployment process
   - For breaking changes: Phased deployment with version management

4. **Post-deployment Verification**: Verify the changes are working as expected in production.

5. **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage and error rates to detect any issues.

### 5. Change Communication

1. **Release Notes**: Publish detailed release notes describing the changes, including:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - How to adapt to the changes (for breaking changes)
   - Examples of new or modified requests/responses

2. **API Changelog**: Update the API changelog with a summary of the changes.

3. **Notification**: Notify API consumers through established communication channels.

## Version Management

### Versioning Strategy

The BASB system uses semantic versioning for APIs:

- **Major Version (v1, v2)**: Incremented for breaking changes
- **Minor Version (v1.1, v1.2)**: Incremented for non-breaking feature additions
- **Patch Version (v1.1.1, v1.1.2)**: Incremented for bug fixes and minor improvements

### Version Compatibility

- Major versions are exposed in the URL path: `/api/v1/...`, `/api/v2/...`
- Minor and patch versions are tracked internally and documented in release notes
- Previous major versions are supported for at least 6 months after a new major version is released
- Deprecation notices are provided at least 3 months before removing support for a major version

## Communication Plan

### Communication Channels

- API Developer Portal
- Email notifications to registered API consumers
- Release notes in documentation
- Changelog in API repository
- Developer forum announcements

### Communication Timeline

- **Non-Breaking Changes**:
  - Announcement in release notes upon deployment
  - Update to API documentation upon deployment

- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Initial announcement at least 3 months before deployment
  - Reminder announcements at 2 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, and 1 week before deployment
  - Detailed migration guide published at least 2 months before deployment
  - Final announcement upon deployment
  - Follow-up communication 1 week after deployment

## Deprecation Process

### Deprecation Steps

1. **Mark as Deprecated**: Update API documentation to mark the endpoint, parameter, or feature as deprecated.

2. **Add Deprecation Notice**: Add a deprecation notice in API responses using HTTP headers or response properties:
   ```
   X-Deprecated: true
   X-Deprecated-Reason: "This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on 2024-12-31. Please use /api/v2/new-endpoint instead."
   ```

3. **Monitor Usage**: Track usage of deprecated features to identify consumers that need to migrate.

4. **Targeted Communication**: Directly contact consumers still using deprecated features.

5. **Removal**: Remove the deprecated feature according to the communicated timeline.

### Deprecation Timeline

- Minimum 6-month deprecation period for major features
- Minimum 3-month deprecation period for minor features
- Clear communication of removal dates in all deprecation notices

## Emergency Changes

### Emergency Change Process

For critical issues requiring immediate changes (security vulnerabilities, critical bugs):

1. **Expedited Review**: Abbreviated review process involving only essential stakeholders.

2. **Expedited Implementation**: Focused implementation addressing only the critical issue.

3. **Emergency Deployment**: Accelerated deployment process with appropriate safeguards.

4. **Post-Implementation Review**: Comprehensive review after the emergency change to ensure quality and identify process improvements.

5. **Emergency Communication**: Immediate notification to affected API consumers through all available channels.
